"""Worked research questions served as MCP prompts.

Each prompt is a research question a model can run against this server:
the tools to call (named exactly as registered), the arguments to pass
them, what each call is for, and the limits an honest answer has to
respect. ``guide.py`` turns these into MCP ``Prompt`` / ``GetPromptResult``
objects; this module holds the data and the text rendering only.

Step arguments are data (``Step.args``), not prose, so the tests can hold
every argument a prompt tells a model to pass against that tool's
``inputSchema``: the name exists, a required parameter is supplied, an
enum value is allowed and a number is a number. Every tool named here
must exist in the live registry, and every ``intel_*`` name that appears
anywhere in a rendered prompt, argument values included, must be one of
that prompt's own tools. ``tests/test_guide.py`` pins all of this, so a
renamed tool or parameter fails the suite instead of leaving a prompt
that sends a model somewhere that is not there.

Gaps / not covered:
- The tests check argument names, types and enum values against the
  schemas and output-field names against the package source. They cannot
  check that a step's purpose text describes what the tool returns; that
  rests on reading the source modules.
