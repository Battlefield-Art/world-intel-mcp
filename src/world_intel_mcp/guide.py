"""Research guide served over MCP as resources and prompts.

A model connecting to this server sees every registered tool and, before
this module, nothing else: no map of which tool answers which question, and no
statement of what the data cannot support. The guide fills that gap with
three read-only resources, a set of worked research prompts
(``guide_prompts.py``) and the server's ``instructions`` at initialize:

- ``intel://guide``: how to ask a strong question, what an answer
  contains, what this server will not do, the prompts, and every
  registered tool grouped by its domain module, with the environment
  variables a tool cannot work without. The tool list is built from the
  live registry (``tools._MODULES``) on every read, so it cannot drift
  from what ``tools/list`` serves.
- ``intel://guide/source-health``: circuit breakers, stale serves, cache
  freshness and which keyed sources have their environment variables
  set, with a one-line verdict that says when there is nothing to go on
  yet. It reads in-process state and the cache database only; reading it
  never starts a fetch, and an unreadable cache is reported, not raised.
- ``intel://guide/measures``: a glossary of the measures the tools
  return and the mistakes they invite.

Gaps / not covered:
- Source health cannot see the collector's run log or schedule, nor the
  breaker state of other processes (collector, dashboard, CLI); it says
  so in its ``scope`` field.
- ``keyed_sources`` reports whether a variable is set, not whether the
  key is valid or within quota.
- A cache file moved or deleted while the server holds it open keeps
  answering from the open handle; source health cannot tell.
- The guide states no count of tools that return no failure marker under
  a total outage, because the count changes as tools are added. A review
  sweep at 7782d22 (137 of its 139 tools, each in a fresh process with a
  fresh breaker and cache, every request failing) found 68 of the
  105 tools that called a source returned no error, degraded or data_gaps
  field; an earlier single-process sweep read 53 of 85 because shared
  circuit breakers stopped 17 tools from calling at all. Neither figure
  is recomputed here.

# World Intelligence MCP: research guide

This server answers questions about the world with live public data:
markets, conflict, hazards, migration, aviation, cyber, infrastructure,
news and more. This guide is generated from the running server: {tools}
tools in {domains} domains, and {prompts} worked research prompts.

Other resources: `intel://guide/source-health` (which sources are
failing, stale or missing keys right now) and `intel://guide/measures`
(what the numbers mean and how they mislead).

## How to ask a strong question

- Name the period: "the last 30 days against the 30 days before", not
  "recently".
- Name the comparison: an earlier period, another place, or a stated
  baseline.
- Name the measure: event count or fatalities, price level or percentage
  change, people displaced at year end or arrivals during the year.
- Name the place: a country (many tools take an ISO-3 code), a region, a
  bounding box, or a saved area of interest.

A question with all four can be answered from tool output. A question
with none of them invites a story.

## What an answer from this server contains

- Values as the sources published them. Most responses name their source
  and carry a fetch timestamp; the date a value describes is often earlier
  than the fetch, so give both. Some tools return no observation date at
  all; say so rather than using the fetch time.
- Failures, sometimes. Some tools return `error`, `degraded` or
  `data_gaps` when a source is down or not configured. Many do not: when
  every upstream request fails they return an empty list, a zero count, a
  neutral score, a LOW risk label, an all-clear status or a false flag,
  with no marker. Read an empty list or a zero count as nothing returned,
  not nothing happened, and confirm with a second tool before calling a
  place quiet. `failing_sources` in the source-health resource names the
  sources whose last call failed.
- Citations. Briefs and digests number their sources.
- Old copies, counted. When a live fetch fails and an older cached copy
  exists, that copy is served. Dictionary responses carry `_stale` and
  `_stale_age_seconds`, but tools that reshape a response do not always
  pass the marker through. `stale_serves` in the source-health resource
  counts every stale copy this process served, per source.

## What this server will not do

- Trade, place orders, or say what to buy or sell.
- Forecast prices, elections or wars. Escalation, instability, risk and
  composite scores are weighted summaries of current readings against
  stated baselines, not probabilities.
- Prove causation. Series that move together, or one shortly after the
  other, may share a cause or be coincidence.
- Show history it did not record. Stored history (semantic search,
  timelines, baselines, area change detection) exists only for the time
  the collector or server was running and storing.
- Use keyed sources without their keys. Tools marked [needs ...] in the
  list below return an error naming the variable when it is not set; a
  few others fall back to a keyless source with less detail.
  `without_key` in the source-health resource says which, and whether
  each variable is set.
- See what its sources do not publish. Aircraft without a broadcast
  position, unlisted outlets, and regions outside a feed's coverage are
  absent, which is not the same as quiet.
- Confirm identities. A sanctions or entity name match is a text match.

MEASURES = """\
# Measures glossary

What the numbers returned by this server's tools mean, and the mistakes
they invite.

## Amount outstanding versus flow

An amount outstanding (a stock) is a level at one moment: people
displaced at the end of a year, a central bank's balance sheet, money
supply. A flow is what happened during a period: arrivals during a year,
fund inflows in a week, fatalities in a month. Never add a stock to a
flow. A change in a stock is a net figure: a displaced population that
grew by 100,000 may have had 300,000 arrivals and 200,000 returns.

## Growth versus acceleration

Growth is how fast a level changes (prices 3 percent higher than a year
earlier). Acceleration is how fast the growth rate itself changes
(growth up from 2 to 3 percent). Slower growth is still growth: inflation
falling from 4 to 3 percent means prices are still rising, only more
slowly.

## Percent versus percentage points

A rate that moves from 4 percent to 5 percent rose by 1 percentage
point, which is a 25 percent increase in the rate itself. Yields,
spreads, policy rates and shares are compared in points; one point is
100 basis points.

## Seasonally adjusted

Many series repeat a calendar pattern: holiday spending, winter heating,
summer travel. A seasonally adjusted series has the expected pattern
removed, so one month can be compared with the month before. An
unadjusted series should be compared with the same period a year
earlier. Never compare an adjusted figure with an unadjusted one; check
which a series is before comparing.

## Observation, publication and collection dates

- Observation date: the period a value describes (March unemployment,
  the day an event took place).
- Publication date: when the publisher released it, often weeks after
  the observation, with revisions later still.
- Collection date: when this server fetched or saved it.

A value fetched today can describe last month or last year; annual
datasets such as World Bank indicators often trail by a year or more.
Report the observation date. The fetch time only tells you how fresh the
copy is. Some tools return no observation date; say so.

## Revisions

First releases are estimates. Economic series, event datasets and
displacement figures are revised after publication, sometimes by more
than the change being discussed. Say which release you used.

## Correlation and timing offsets

Two series that move together, or where one tends to move a few days
before the other, may share a cause, may be linked in either direction,
or may be coincidence. Coincidence becomes likely when many pairs or
many offsets are tried and only the best is reported. A lead or lag found
in one sample describes that sample. None of this shows that one thing
caused the other.

## Composite scores

Escalation, instability, risk, macro composite and stress scores are
weighted combinations of current inputs against stated baselines. They
summarize their inputs and are not probabilities. Some add a fixed amount
from a static country table: the instability index's `ucdp_floor` and
`displacement_boost` come from a baseline risk table, not from current
data, so a floor score says nothing about this week. Report the
components with the score; a null component was not measured.

## Missing data is not zero

Many tools report a source that failed, is not configured, or does not
cover a place with an error, a note or a `data_gaps` entry. That means
unknown, not none. Many tools do not: when every upstream request fails
they return an empty list, a zero count, a neutral score, a LOW risk
label, an all-clear status or a false flag, so an empty list or a zero
means nothing was returned, not that nothing happened. Zero events from a fetch that worked, in a region the source
covers and for a query that matched the place, is a measurement; zero
events in a region it does not cover is nothing at all.
