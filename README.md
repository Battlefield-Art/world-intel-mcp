## Architecture

```
server.py     (MCP stdio) ─┐                                               ┌─ VectorStore (Qdrant)
cli.py        (Click CLI)  ├─> sources/*.py ─> Fetcher ─> CircuitBreaker ─┤

```

- **Fetcher**: Centralized async HTTP client (httpx). Retries, per-source rate limiting, stale-data fallback. Auto-stores results in vector store on fresh fetches.
- **CircuitBreaker**: Per-source tracking. 3 consecutive failures trips for 5 minutes. Each RSS feed gets its own breaker.
- **Cache**: SQLite WAL-mode TTL cache. `get()` returns live data, `get_stale()` returns expired data for fallback.
- **VectorStore**: Qdrant + FastEmbed (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, 384-dim). Async background worker queue for non-blocking storage. Enables semantic search across all accumulated intelligence.
- **Collector**: Standalone daemon that fetches all 57 sources in parallel and populates the vector store. Run once or as a daemon (default: 5-minute interval). Includes the AOI change sweep, so a running daemon continuously watches every defined geofence.
- **Sources** (`sources/*.py`): 30+ modules, each exports `async def fetch_*(fetcher, **kwargs) -> dict`.
- **Analysis** (`analysis/*.py`): Cross-domain synthesis — signal aggregation, instability indexing, NLP, company enrichment, macro composite.
- **Config** (`config/*.py`): Curated datasets — 22 hotspots, 70+ bases, 40 ports, 24 pipelines, 24 nuclear facilities, 34 cables, 48 datacenters, 27 spaceports, 82 exchanges.

## Research Guide: MCP Prompts and Resources

Besides its tools, the server answers the MCP `resources` and `prompts`
requests and advertises both capabilities at initialize. A connecting
model can read which tool answers which question, and what the data
cannot support, before it calls anything.

| Resource | Type | What it holds |
|----------|------|---------------|
| `intel://guide` | Markdown | How to ask a strong question (name the period, the comparison, the measure and the place), what an answer contains, what this server will not do, the worked prompts, and every tool grouped by domain. Built from the live tool registry on each read, so it always matches `tools/list`. |
| `intel://guide/source-health` | JSON | Open circuit breakers, stale serves, cache freshness per source prefix, and which keyed sources have their variables set (names only, never values). Reading it starts no fetch. Breaker state covers this server process only; the collector keeps its own. A `verdict` line says when there is nothing to go on yet (no requests made and an empty cache). A cache that cannot be read is reported as `cache.available: false` with the error, next to the rest of the snapshot, and `cache.requested_path` and `cache.fell_back` show when the configured database could not be opened and a temporary one is in use. |
| `intel://guide/measures` | Markdown | Amount outstanding versus flow, growth versus acceleration, percentage points, seasonal adjustment, observation versus publication versus collection dates, revisions, correlation and timing offsets, composite scores, and why missing data is not zero. |

**29 prompts**, each a worked research question that names the tools to
call and the limits an honest answer respects (arguments marked * are
required):

| Domain | Prompts |
|--------|---------|
| conflict | `conflict-trend` (country*, days), `hotspot-escalation` |
| markets | `market-risk-snapshot`, `yield-curve-check`, `central-bank-compare`, `fx-move` (symbol*, base, days), `company-events` (ticker*), `energy-pressure`, `crypto-structure` |
| hazards | `earthquake-exposure` (min_magnitude, hours), `severe-weather` (us_area, europe_country), `wildfire-situation` (region), `space-weather-impact` |
| migration | `displacement-history` (country*, role), `migration-surges` (year) |
| aviation | `airspace-anomaly` (cohort, region), `airport-disruption` |
| cyber | `cyber-landscape` |
| infrastructure | `internet-disruption` (country*, resource), `cloud-incidents` |
| maritime | `maritime-chokepoints` |
| aoi | `aoi-watch-setup` (name*, lat*, lon*, radius_km*), `aoi-review` (name*) |
| news | `story-breadth` (topic*) |
| politics | `election-watch` (country) |
| finance | `sanctions-screen` (query*) |
| health | `disease-watch` |
| history | `history-recall` (topic*, hours) |
| country | `country-overview` (country*) |

`prompts/get` with `conflict-trend` and `{"country": "Sudan"}` returns one
user message: the question with Sudan and the default 30-day window
filled in, the numbered tools (`intel_ucdp_events`, `intel_acled_events`,
`intel_unrest_events`) with the arguments to pass and what each call is
for, the limits (recent days are the least complete; count events and
fatalities separately; compare each source only with itself), and the
shape of a complete answer. A missing required argument, an unknown
argument, a number outside its range (latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180
to 180, an AOI radius of 1 to 2000 km), a value outside an argument's
list, a value that names a tool the prompt does not call, or an unknown
prompt is an `invalid params` error, never a guess. The tests fail if a
prompt names a tool that is not registered, passes an argument the
tool's schema does not take (wrong name, type or listed value), cites an
output field the code does not produce, describes a step in words that
share nothing with the called tool's own description, or if the guide
leaves out a registered tool. Tools that cannot work without an API key carry a
`[needs VARIABLE]` mark in the guide's tool list.

From the shell, `intel guide` prints the same guide markdown and
`intel guide --measures` prints the glossary. `intel guide` builds its
tool list from the live registry, so it opens the cache database and
creates it on first run (`~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/cache.db`, or the
path set by `WORLD_INTEL_CACHE_DB` or `XDG_CACHE_HOME`). Starting the CLI
at all, `intel --help` and `intel guide --measures` included, creates
`~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/temporal.db` under your home directory.

### Aviation (5)
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `intel_airport_delays` | FAA airport delay status |
| `intel_aviation_domestic` | Global air traffic snapshot from OpenSky |
| `intel_jet_cohort_snapshot` | Live airborne business-jet (ICAO type designators) or military cohort from adsb.lol; learns cohort membership as a side effect |
| `intel_jet_activity_anomaly` | Peak concurrent airborne cohort aircraft in a UTC half-hour vs the same slot on prior same-weekday dates (holiday-adjacent dates swapped out); robust z, alert level 1-5, deficit flag |
| `intel_jet_excess_origins` | Infers takeoffs/landings from heatmap tracks, density-clusters endpoints, and reports clusters above their baseline median: departure/arrival anchor, regional, or diffuse |

**Cohort early warning.** The three `intel_jet_*` tools watch a cohort of aircraft
(business jets by ICAO type designator, or military) for activity that departs
from its calendar baseline, and locate where an excess came from. Data:
adsb.lol's live API and its public half-hour `globe_history` heatmaps (readsb
format, ODbL 1.0, no key). Heatmaps are ~14 MB each and immutable once
published, so they are cached on disk next to the cache DB
(`WORLD_INTEL_HEATMAP_CACHE_MB`, default 1024) and fetched at most one at a
time with a 2 s floor. The cohort is *learned* from live snapshots (run
`intel_jet_cohort_snapshot` or the collector daemon, which now includes
`bizjet_cohort` and `military_cohort`); the analyses only use members first
seen `min_learning_lead_hours` (default 24) before the window, because a
cohort learned during a window inflates that window (measured: 1,002 vs a
206 baseline median when the gate is bypassed). Until the cohort has that
lead, the tools answer `warming_up`. The baseline is a handful of
same-weekday slots fetched on demand, not a year-long backfill, so there
are no learned holiday profiles or annual ratios.

Approach inspired by [kylemcdonald/ews](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ews)
(Early Warning System: business-jet cohorts against calendar baselines, and
the excess-origin detector). This is an independent implementation over a
different, openly licensed data source; no ews code is used.

### Collection History (6)
History accrues only while the collector (`intel-collector`) runs; nothing before its first recorded cycle exists, except what a backfill loads (`intel_history_backfill`, `intel history backfill`): FRED graph CSV and ECB Data Portal series, stored under `backfill:fred` and `backfill:ecb` with the publisher's current vintage, so revisions made before the first backfill are invisible. Every observation keeps three dates: `observed_at` (the period the value describes, from the payload, or null when the payload has none), `published_at` (publisher release, when known) and `collected_at` (when this server saved it).

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `intel_collection_health` | Per-source health from the collector's run log: last attempt, last success, consecutive failures, overdue against the expected cadence, never-run sources, history storage size; states what it cannot prove (a fresh capture does not mean upstream observations are current) |
| `intel_capture_history` | A source's earlier captures (ok / degraded / error with reason, duration, record count) and whether each changed from the previous one; `capture_id` replays one stored payload |
| `intel_series_history` | One series' observations with all three dates, or the list of available series |
| `intel_revisions` | Values for the same `observed_at` that a later capture changed (USGS magnitude revisions, NOAA Kp updates) |
| `intel_day_timeline` | What the history store holds for one UTC day (`YYYY-MM-DD`; a future day is an error). `by=collected` (default): per source, that day's captures (attempts, ok / degraded / error with reasons, changed vs unchanged payloads, first and last capture, observations stored), and for a source with no capture whether the collector did not run that day, ran without it, never ran it, or the day is past run-log retention. `by=observed`: values whose `observed_at` falls on the day; month and year values containing the day are listed apart as period values, and undated observations are counted and excluded. Every item carries `observed_at`, `published_at` and `collected_at`; pruned records are named, never read as a quiet day; per-source and total caps with truncation disclosed. Read-only, never fetches |
| `intel_history_backfill` | Load the history FRED (graph CSV) or the ECB Data Portal already serve into the history store: one capture per series under `backfill:fred` / `backfill:ecb`, `observed_at` from the publisher's dates, `published_at` null, `collected_at` the backfill time; re-runs store only new or changed values (a change is a revision); missing values skipped and counted; writes and fetches, so capped at 5 FRED series or 2 ECB keys per call |

### Connections Between Series (1)
Reads the history store only, so the sample is what the collector saved, not each series' full history. A connection is a correlation in that sample: it does not show causation, and a lead does not show causal direction.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `intel_lagged_connections` | Correlation between 2 to 8 stored series (keys as `intel_series_history` lists them) on a UTC day, week or month grid, tested at every lag from `-max_lag` to `+max_lag` (default 5, at most 30, at most 1,000 tests a call). Default transform is period-over-period changes, because levels of trending series correlate spuriously; `levels` on request. Per pair: the lag with the smallest p, with Pearson r, overlap n, two-sided p from Student's t and the Benjamini-Hochberg q across every test in the call (significant at q <= 0.05 by default). Lag +k compares A at period t with B at t+k, so A leads B by k. Pair/lag overlaps under 30 points are listed as not tested with their n; revised points use the latest vintage; rows without `observed_at` (Yahoo quotes) are not used. Each strongest result also carries an AR(1) effective sample size as a serial-correlation diagnostic |

## Watching your own area (geofences/AOIs)

Static infrastructure results (bases, ports, nuclear, cables, datacenters, spaceports) draw on this repo's curated strategic datasets, which are global and deliberately sparse, not exhaustive local registries. A quiet AOI brief means nothing from those curated sets is in range, not that your area has no infrastructure.

Before the AOI family, only `intel_signal_convergence` accepted a real
point-plus-radius, `intel_military_flights` took a bbox, and hotspot
escalation scoring was restricted to the 22 hardcoded `INTEL_HOTSPOTS`.
The `intel_aoi_*` tools let you name your own area (a city, a border
region, a facility) and get the same cited, multi-domain treatment.
Geofences survive the antimeridian (a Bering Strait or Fiji AOI queries
both sides of the dateline), and pipelines/undersea cables are matched
as line features via great-circle segment distance, not just by their
endpoints.

Define an AOI once, then brief, score, edit, and watch it. Three
shapes: a circle (point + radius), a polygon (3-64 vertices, for a
border region or strait a radius cannot express), or a corridor (a
waypoint route + width, for a shipping lane or supply road):

```
intel_aoi_define(name="Pittsburgh", lat=40.4406, lon=-79.9959, radius_km=50)
intel_aoi_define_polygon(name="Taiwan Strait", vertices=[[22.5, 118.0], [22.5, 121.5], [26.5, 122.0], [26.5, 118.5]])
intel_aoi_define_corridor(name="Suez Approach", waypoints=[[29.9, 32.55], [27.5, 34.0], [24.0, 36.0]], width_km=80)
intel_aoi_brief(name="Taiwan Strait")
intel_aoi_escalation(name="Pittsburgh")
intel_aoi_update(name="Pittsburgh", radius_km=100)   # resize/rename in place
intel_aoi_changes(name="Suez Approach")  # what entered/left since last sweep
intel_aoi_digest()  # one-call sweep across ALL your areas
```

The same nine operations are available from the terminal: `intel aoi define|define-polygon|define-corridor|list|update|delete|brief|escalation|changes`.

Membership is exact for the shape (an event inside a polygon's
bounding circle but outside the polygon is excluded); corridor
distances are measured to the route. Line-feature infrastructure
(pipelines, undersea cables) matches the bounding circle for
non-circle shapes, disclosed in `data_gaps`.

`intel_aoi_changes` is the alerting primitive: the first call records a
baseline, and every later call reports what entered and left the fence
per domain, with failed fetches reported as `data_gaps` rather than
counted as departures.

`intel_aoi_brief` filters every geo-capable domain to the 50 km radius
around Pittsburgh: earthquakes, military flights (bbox derived from the
radius), wildfires (region-mapped, since NASA FIRMS has no point+radius
query), ACLED conflict events, a sample of nearby aviation traffic,
nearby static infrastructure (military bases, ports, pipelines, nuclear
facilities, undersea cables, datacenters, spaceports) with distances in
km, and news headline mentions of "Pittsburgh". Every item in the
response carries a `[n]` citation into a numbered `sources` list, and
`data_gaps` names any domain that couldn't be scoped to the AOI (for
example, wildfires when the AOI falls outside NASA FIRMS's coverage
regions, or conflict events when ACLED credentials aren't configured)
instead of silently omitting it.

`intel_aoi_escalation` runs the same baseline/military/conflict/social-
unrest scoring engine that powers `intel_hotspot_escalation` for the 22
built-in hotspots, but scoped to your AOI's own radius instead of a fixed
2-degree window. It also scores the two components the built-ins leave
null. News is the rise in the area's share of all GDELT coverage over the
last 7 days against the 7 before, for the reverse-geocoded place (the
same query the brief uses), so a swing or outage in what GDELT ingests is
not read as a news surge. Convergence runs the multi-domain convergence
grid over the earthquakes, military flights, ACLED events and wildfires
inside the AOI's exact shape. If either one's inputs fail, it comes back
null with the reason in `data_gaps`, never as a 0, and `computed_from`
names the components the score was computed from
(`zero_filled_components` flags any that are a 0 only because the
military or ACLED fetch failed).

AOIs persist in a dedicated table inside the same SQLite cache database
the server already uses (`$WORLD_INTEL_CACHE_DB` when set, otherwise
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/world-intel-mcp/cache.db`, falling back to
`~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/cache.db`), so a scheduled agent can watch any named
area across restarts with `intel_aoi_list` / `intel_aoi_delete` to manage
them.

Temporal and keyword spike baselines use `temporal.db` and
`keyword_spikes.db` in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/world-intel-mcp/`, or
`~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is unset.
`WORLD_INTEL_CACHE_DB` only overrides the main cache database, not these
baseline files. Databases open on first use, not on import. If you set
`XDG_CACHE_HOME`, move the two baseline files from `~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/`
to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/world-intel-mcp/` to keep existing baselines.

## Vector Store

The optional Qdrant vector store accumulates intelligence over time for semantic retrieval. All data fetched through the Fetcher is automatically embedded and stored.

### Setup

```bash
# Install Qdrant (Docker)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Install vector dependencies
pip install -e ".[vector]"

# Run the collector daemon (populates vector store 24/7)
intel-collector --daemon              # every 5 minutes
intel-collector --daemon --interval 120  # every 2 minutes
intel-collector --sources markets,cyber  # specific domains only
intel-collector                        # single collection cycle
intel-collector --daemon --sources aoi --interval 900  # AOI watch only: sweep every geofence every 15 min
```

The `aoi` group runs `intel_aoi_digest` as a sweep: each cycle diffs every
defined AOI against its stored snapshot and advances it, so the daemon
interval is your geofence watch cadence. Change digests are logged and
(when the vector store is enabled) stored for semantic search. Set
`WORLD_INTEL_AOI_WEBHOOK` to get a POST whenever a sweep finds something
entered or left a geofence (quiet sweeps never fire); with
`WORLD_INTEL_AOI_WEBHOOK_FORMAT=text` the body is raw markdown with a
`Title` header, which ntfy-style sinks render directly.

### Running as a macOS launchd Service

`scripts/collector-daemon.sh` manages the collector as a `launchd` agent so it
survives reboots. It fills in `com.agentic.intel-collector.plist.template`
with this checkout's own path (resolved from the script's own location, so
it works from any clone) and installs the result to
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

```bash
scripts/collector-daemon.sh start    # install + load the launchd job
scripts/collector-daemon.sh status   # check state and log info
scripts/collector-daemon.sh logs     # tail stdout (logs err for stderr)
scripts/collector-daemon.sh stop     # unload the launchd job
scripts/collector-daemon.sh restart
scripts/collector-daemon.sh render   # print the filled-in plist without installing it
```

### Semantic Search Examples

Once data accumulates, AI agents can query across all domains:

- *"military activity near Taiwan strait"* — finds military flights, naval warnings, theater posture data
- *"cyber threats targeting healthcare"* — finds URLhaus, CISA KEV entries related to healthcare
- *"economic indicators suggesting recession"* — finds yield curve inversions, macro signals, FRED data

The vector store uses FastEmbed (ONNX-based, BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) for embeddings — no GPU required, ~3 second cold start.

```

### Adding a New Source

1. Create `sources/your_source.py` with `async def fetch_your_data(fetcher: Fetcher, **kwargs) -> dict`
2. Use `fetcher.get_json(url, source="your-source", cache_key=..., cache_ttl=300)` — automatic caching, retries, circuit breaking, rate limiting
3. In `server.py`: add `Tool(...)` to `TOOLS`, add `case` to `_dispatch()` (use inline import)
4. Add tests using `respx` to mock HTTP (see `tests/test_forex.py` for pattern)
5. Optionally add to `dashboard/app.py` (SSE) and `cli.py` (Click)
