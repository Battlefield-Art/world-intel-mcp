## Architecture

```
server.py     (MCP stdio) ─┐                                               ┌─ VectorStore (Qdrant)
cli.py        (Click CLI)  ├─> sources/*.py ─> Fetcher ─> CircuitBreaker ─┤
dashboard.py  (SSE)        │    analysis/*.py                              └─ Cache (SQLite)
collector.py  (daemon)    ─┘
```

- **Fetcher**: Centralized async HTTP client (httpx). Retries, per-source rate limiting, stale-data fallback. Auto-stores results in vector store on fresh fetches.
- **CircuitBreaker**: Per-source tracking. 3 consecutive failures trips for 5 minutes. Each RSS feed gets its own breaker.
- **Cache**: SQLite WAL-mode TTL cache. `get()` returns live data, `get_stale()` returns expired data for fallback.
- **VectorStore**: Qdrant + FastEmbed (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, 384-dim). Async background worker queue for non-blocking storage. Enables semantic search across all accumulated intelligence.
- **Collector**: Standalone daemon that fetches all 55 sources in parallel and populates the vector store. Run once or as a daemon (default: 5-minute interval). Includes the AOI change sweep, so a running daemon continuously watches every defined geofence.
- **Sources** (`sources/*.py`): 30+ modules, each exports `async def fetch_*(fetcher, **kwargs) -> dict`.
- **Analysis** (`analysis/*.py`): Cross-domain synthesis — signal aggregation, instability indexing, NLP, company enrichment, macro composite.
- **Config** (`config/*.py`): Curated datasets — 22 hotspots, 70+ bases, 40 ports, 24 pipelines, 24 nuclear facilities, 34 cables, 48 datacenters, 27 spaceports, 82 exchanges.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `intel_airport_delays` | FAA airport delay status |
| `intel_aviation_domestic` | Global air traffic snapshot from OpenSky |
| `intel_jet_cohort_snapshot` | Live airborne business-jet (ICAO type designators) or military cohort from adsb.lol; learns cohort membership as a side effect |
| `intel_jet_activity_anomaly` | Peak concurrent airborne cohort aircraft in a UTC half-hour vs the same slot on prior same-weekday dates (holiday-adjacent dates swapped out); robust z, alert level 1-5, deficit flag |
| `intel_jet_excess_origins` | Infers takeoffs/landings from heatmap tracks, density-clusters endpoints, and reports clusters above their baseline median: departure/arrival anchor, regional, or diffuse |

**Cohort early warning.** The three `intel_jet_*` tools watch a cohort of aircraft
(business jets by ICAO type designator, or military) for activity that departs
from its calendar baseline, and locate where an excess came from. Data:
adsb.lol's live API and its public half-hour `globe_history` heatmaps (readsb
format, ODbL 1.0, no key). Heatmaps are ~14 MB each and immutable once
published, so they are cached on disk next to the cache DB
(`WORLD_INTEL_HEATMAP_CACHE_MB`, default 1024) and fetched at most one at a
time with a 2 s floor. The cohort is *learned* from live snapshots (run
`intel_jet_cohort_snapshot` or the collector daemon, which now includes
`bizjet_cohort` and `military_cohort`); the analyses only use members first
seen `min_learning_lead_hours` (default 24) before the window, because a
cohort learned during a window inflates that window (measured: 1,002 vs a
206 baseline median when the gate is bypassed). Until the cohort has that
lead, the tools answer `warming_up`. The baseline is a handful of
same-weekday slots fetched on demand, not a year-long backfill, so there
are no learned holiday profiles or annual ratios.

Approach inspired by [kylemcdonald/ews](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ews)
(Early Warning System: business-jet cohorts against calendar baselines, and
the excess-origin detector). This is an independent implementation over a
different, openly licensed data source; no ews code is used.

## Watching your own area (geofences/AOIs)

Static infrastructure results (bases, ports, nuclear, cables, datacenters, spaceports) draw on this repo's curated strategic datasets, which are global and deliberately sparse, not exhaustive local registries. A quiet AOI brief means nothing from those curated sets is in range, not that your area has no infrastructure.

Before the AOI family, only `intel_signal_convergence` accepted a real
point-plus-radius, `intel_military_flights` took a bbox, and hotspot
escalation scoring was restricted to the 22 hardcoded `INTEL_HOTSPOTS`.
The `intel_aoi_*` tools let you name your own area (a city, a border
region, a facility) and get the same cited, multi-domain treatment.
Geofences survive the antimeridian (a Bering Strait or Fiji AOI queries
both sides of the dateline), and pipelines/undersea cables are matched
as line features via great-circle segment distance, not just by their
endpoints.

Define an AOI once, then brief, score, edit, and watch it. Three
shapes: a circle (point + radius), a polygon (3-64 vertices, for a
border region or strait a radius cannot express), or a corridor (a
waypoint route + width, for a shipping lane or supply road):

```
intel_aoi_define(name="Pittsburgh", lat=40.4406, lon=-79.9959, radius_km=50)
intel_aoi_define_polygon(name="Taiwan Strait", vertices=[[22.5, 118.0], [22.5, 121.5], [26.5, 122.0], [26.5, 118.5]])
intel_aoi_define_corridor(name="Suez Approach", waypoints=[[29.9, 32.55], [27.5, 34.0], [24.0, 36.0]], width_km=80)
intel_aoi_brief(name="Taiwan Strait")
intel_aoi_escalation(name="Pittsburgh")
intel_aoi_update(name="Pittsburgh", radius_km=100)   # resize/rename in place
intel_aoi_changes(name="Suez Approach")  # what entered/left since last sweep
intel_aoi_digest()  # one-call sweep across ALL your areas
```

The same nine operations are available from the terminal: `intel aoi define|define-polygon|define-corridor|list|update|delete|brief|escalation|changes`.

Membership is exact for the shape (an event inside a polygon's
bounding circle but outside the polygon is excluded); corridor
distances are measured to the route. Line-feature infrastructure
(pipelines, undersea cables) matches the bounding circle for
non-circle shapes, disclosed in `data_gaps`.

`intel_aoi_changes` is the alerting primitive: the first call records a
baseline, and every later call reports what entered and left the fence
per domain, with failed fetches reported as `data_gaps` rather than
counted as departures.

`intel_aoi_brief` filters every geo-capable domain to the 50 km radius
around Pittsburgh: earthquakes, military flights (bbox derived from the
radius), wildfires (region-mapped, since NASA FIRMS has no point+radius
query), ACLED conflict events, a sample of nearby aviation traffic,
nearby static infrastructure (military bases, ports, pipelines, nuclear
facilities, undersea cables, datacenters, spaceports) with distances in
km, and news headline mentions of "Pittsburgh". Every item in the
response carries a `[n]` citation into a numbered `sources` list, and
`data_gaps` names any domain that couldn't be scoped to the AOI (for
example, wildfires when the AOI falls outside NASA FIRMS's coverage
regions, or conflict events when ACLED credentials aren't configured)
instead of silently omitting it.

`intel_aoi_escalation` runs the same baseline/military/conflict/social-
unrest scoring engine that powers `intel_hotspot_escalation` for the 22
built-in hotspots, but scoped to your AOI's own radius instead of a fixed
2-degree window.

AOIs persist in a dedicated table inside the same SQLite cache database
the server already uses (`~/.cache/world-intel-mcp/cache.db` by default,
or `$WORLD_INTEL_CACHE_DB`), so a scheduled agent can watch any named
area across restarts with `intel_aoi_list` / `intel_aoi_delete` to manage
them.

## Vector Store

The optional Qdrant vector store accumulates intelligence over time for semantic retrieval. All data fetched through the Fetcher is automatically embedded and stored.

### Setup

```bash
# Install Qdrant (Docker)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Install vector dependencies
pip install -e ".[vector]"

# Run the collector daemon (populates vector store 24/7)
intel-collector --daemon              # every 5 minutes
intel-collector --daemon --interval 120  # every 2 minutes
intel-collector --sources markets,cyber  # specific domains only
intel-collector                        # single collection cycle
intel-collector --daemon --sources aoi --interval 900  # AOI watch only: sweep every geofence every 15 min
```

The `aoi` group runs `intel_aoi_digest` as a sweep: each cycle diffs every
defined AOI against its stored snapshot and advances it, so the daemon
interval is your geofence watch cadence. Change digests are logged and
(when the vector store is enabled) stored for semantic search. Set
`WORLD_INTEL_AOI_WEBHOOK` to get a POST whenever a sweep finds something
entered or left a geofence (quiet sweeps never fire); with
`WORLD_INTEL_AOI_WEBHOOK_FORMAT=text` the body is raw markdown with a
`Title` header, which ntfy-style sinks render directly.

### Running as a macOS launchd Service

`scripts/collector-daemon.sh` manages the collector as a `launchd` agent so it
survives reboots. It fills in `com.agentic.intel-collector.plist.template`
with this checkout's own path (resolved from the script's own location, so
it works from any clone) and installs the result to
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

```bash
scripts/collector-daemon.sh start    # install + load the launchd job
scripts/collector-daemon.sh status   # check state and log info
scripts/collector-daemon.sh logs     # tail stdout (logs err for stderr)
scripts/collector-daemon.sh stop     # unload the launchd job
scripts/collector-daemon.sh restart
scripts/collector-daemon.sh render   # print the filled-in plist without installing it
```

### Semantic Search Examples

Once data accumulates, AI agents can query across all domains:

- *"military activity near Taiwan strait"* — finds military flights, naval warnings, theater posture data
- *"cyber threats targeting healthcare"* — finds URLhaus, CISA KEV entries related to healthcare
- *"economic indicators suggesting recession"* — finds yield curve inversions, macro signals, FRED data

The vector store uses FastEmbed (ONNX-based, BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) for embeddings — no GPU required, ~3 second cold start.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                       # 900 tests (918 total, 18 live-network smoke tests deselected by default)
pytest --cov=world_intel_mcp # with coverage
pytest tests/test_forex.py -v # single module
```

### Adding a New Source

1. Create `sources/your_source.py` with `async def fetch_your_data(fetcher: Fetcher, **kwargs) -> dict`
2. Use `fetcher.get_json(url, source="your-source", cache_key=..., cache_ttl=300)` — automatic caching, retries, circuit breaking, rate limiting
3. In `server.py`: add `Tool(...)` to `TOOLS`, add `case` to `_dispatch()` (use inline import)
4. Add tests using `respx` to mock HTTP (see `tests/test_forex.py` for pattern)
5. Optionally add to `dashboard/app.py` (SSE) and `cli.py` (Click)
